Heroes and Villians

Lesson 1: HTML and Semantics

Original text file The original H&V content as it was given to us

HTML Content sorted and formatted using HTML

Lesson 2: Art Direction and Element Collages

Mood Board Mood board to get an idea of what I want to show with my website.

Style Tile Defining specific design elements for my the H&V website

Lesson 3: Typography

See above (Bird Project, Lesson 3: Typography) The text shadow effect I learned in this exercise is something I tried to replicate in this project to create a cheesy 8-bit game feel to my site.

Lesson 4: Responsive Web Design (RWD)

Finished CSS Basic CSS markup including initial microinteractions (revealing content on scroll) and animations.

Media Queries Added a Media Query that changes the site and disables the reveal on scroll that (in this case) doesnt work well on mobile. It makes the information larger and slightly more condensed so it can be viewed better.

Lesson 5: Macro- and Micro-Interactions

Chunking Content - With regards to chunking content, I had already considered this and integrated it into the design when doing the CSS for this site. Each area is given its own heading and there are clear distinctions between the information given about different characters.

Micro-interactions Adding :hover effects so the nav links light up a bit more to mimic a real arcade machine, and the links respond to being hovered over.
