Style Tile Defining specific design elements for my the bird website

Lesson 3: Typography

Typography Project Recreating this type poster with a quote from the game Bioshock Infinite. Here is the original image for comparison.
Lesson 4: Responsive Web Design (RWD)

First formating in CSS First attempt at laying out the text of this piece with CSS. This was later scrapped because I thought this flowing design was too complicated and I later used a simpler layout (which you can see in my second attempt, and finished website)

Finished CSS design My finished CSS design that gives heavy consideration to colour scheme and uses illustrative elements sparingly for more impact.

Media Queries Finished Bird site including a media query for mobile.

Lesson 5: Macro- and Micro-Interactions

Chunking Content - With regards to chunking content, I had already considered this and integrated it into the design when doing the CSS for this site. Each area is given its own section, heading and subheading. I added my own subheadings to the content to liven it up a little and make the story more memorable.

Micro-interactions- I had already included micro-interactions in my finished css site in the table element and also the nav bar.

Lesson 3: Typography

See above (Bird Project, Lesson 3: Typography) The text shadow effect I learned in this exercise is something I tried to replicate in this project to create a cheesy 8-bit game feel to my site.

Lesson 4: Responsive Web Design (RWD)

Finished CSS Basic CSS markup including initial microinteractions (revealing content on scroll) and animations.

Media Queries Added a Media Query that changes the site and disables the reveal on scroll that (in this case) doesnt work well on mobile. It makes the information larger and slightly more condensed so it can be viewed better.

Lesson 5: Macro- and Micro-Interactions

Chunking Content - With regards to chunking content, I had already considered this and integrated it into the design when doing the CSS for this site. Each area is given its own heading and there are clear distinctions between the information given about different characters.

Micro-interactions Adding :hover effects so the nav links light up a bit more to mimic a real arcade machine, and the links respond to being hovered over.
